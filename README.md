### Job offers scrapper
The application is accessing a given web page and extract job offer inside. 
Currently targeting only `nofluffjobs`. 

### Motivation and goal
In a vast and empty world of ghosting when looking for a job your CV must be perfect. 
To achieve that tremendous task you need to rewrite your CV tens of millions of times 
every single day. Just to be ignored by recruiters (or their application tracking AI based 
crappy solution). The app is supposed to fetch an offer and using AI (of course AI) extract a keywords
describing the position and modify your CV.
